# Contributing to IPS GitHub Projects

This GitHub organization is used by the [Institute of Production Systems](https://ips.mb.tu-dortmund.de/) (IPS) to manage and share various projects and resources.

## üõ†Ô∏è Scope
This platform hosts:
- Research projects
- Software tools, scripts, and prototypes
- Educational and public resources

Projects containing sensitive or confidential information should be managed separately.

## üí° How to Contribute
- **Internal colleagues** can directly create new repositories under the organization.
- For changes within an existing repository:
  1. Create a **feature branch** (e.g. `feature/your-topic`).
  2. Make your changes.
  3. Open a **Pull Request** if possible, even within your own project ‚Äî this allows easy review and documentation of changes.

- **External contributions** (if allowed for a project) should follow the fork-branch-pull-request model.

## üìö General Guidelines
- Maintain a professional and respectful tone in discussions and commit messages.
- Write meaningful commit messages (e.g., `feat: add evaluation script for dataset`, `docs: update user instructions`).
- Add clear documentation where needed (README updates, usage examples, etc.).
- Each repository should have a short project description and, if possible, a license file.
