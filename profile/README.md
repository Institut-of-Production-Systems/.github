# Institute of Production Systems (IPS)

## ðŸ‘‹ About Us
The [Institute of Production Systems](https://ips.mb.tu-dortmund.de/) (IPS) at [TU Dortmund](https://www.tu-dortmund.de/) has a strong heritage in the fields of labor and time management, dating back to the 1970s. Since 2005, under the leadership of Professor Jochen Deuse, we have further developed industrial engineering by systematically integrating knowledge from computer science and statistics.

From our holistic and systemic view of production systems, four core research areas have emerged:
- **Work System Design**
- **Industrial Data Science**
- **Digital Factory**
- **Dynamic Value Stream Design**

We drive the transformation toward digitalized industrial engineering â€” starting in Dortmund and reaching beyond regional borders.  

## ðŸ¥… Purpose of this GitHub Organization
This GitHub organization serves as a **central platform** for a wide variety of IPS projects, including:
- Research projects
- Software prototypes
- Tools, scripts, and templates
- Educational resources

While some more sensitive projects remain on private infrastructure (e.g. our GitLab), this platform provides an *open space* for knowledge sharing, cooperation, and innovation.
